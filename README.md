# Offline-Eaglercraft-Collection
This repository is a (in)complete Eaglercraft file collection made by me. All of these files work offline. Eaglercraft is a open-source Minecraft client that runs entirely in a web browser using JavaScript. It allows users to play Minecraft, without needing to download a separate client. This makes it accessible on various devices, including Chromebooks. It's developed and maintained by lax1dude, and the source code is open-source, allowing others to contribute and modify it, but this edition was not created by lax1dude. The 1.9 file does work, but I don't know why it has the current textures unlike the 1.12.2 file. I would add the Scratch Edition since it is WAY better than any Minecraft version you'll find on actual Scratch, but the file is too large to put on GitHub. If anyone knows a way around this, please inform me. 1.11 is also a work in progress, and is coming soon.
