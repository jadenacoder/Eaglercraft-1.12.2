# Eaglercraft-1.12.2
This repository is the Eaglercraft 1.12.2 file. It does work offline. Eaglercraft is a open-source Minecraft client that runs entirely in a web browser using JavaScript. It allows users to play Minecraft, without needing to download a separate client. This makes it accessible on various devices, including Chromebooks. It's developed and maintained by lax1dude, and the source code is open-source, allowing others to contribute and modify it, but this edition was not created by lax1dude. Although most Eaglercraft files are running 1.5.2 or 1.8.8 this version is 1.12.2. I also have a 1.9 file, but I do not know who made it. The 1.9 files does work, but I don't know if anyone would want it since we have 1.12.2 right here. If you're going for aesthetics, the 1.9 file would be the better choice since it has the current textures unlike the 1.12.2 file. If you want the 1.12 file please inform me so I can post it.

Your welcome, in advance.
